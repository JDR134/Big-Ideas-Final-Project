    "# The best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh (For Squatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "While deliberating on what we could be used to define the best neighborhood in Pittbsurgh, we came to the conlucison that if we were ever to end up in a disadvantaged position and school did not work out for us, we should know where the best place for us to hide out would be. We wanted to know where we could go if we had no other options. With the data we had available to us we decided to analyze the Liklihood of Arrest for Trespassing, the Social Services available to us in a given neighborhood, and the Available Properties that could possibly be available for someone to squat in. Through weighing all these metrics would could cross reference what would be the best neighborhood for access to food, shelter, and avoiding law enforcement. \n"
