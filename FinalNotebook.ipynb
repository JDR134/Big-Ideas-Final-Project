    "# The best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh (For Squatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "While deliberating on what we could be used to define the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we came to the conclusion that if we were ever to end up in a disadvantaged position and school did not work out for us, we should know where the best place for us to hide out would be. We wanted to know where we could go if we had no other options. With the data we had available to us we decided to analyze the Likelihood of Arrest for Trespassing, the Social Services available to us in a given neighborhood, and the Available Properties that could possibly be available for someone to squat in. Through weighing all these metrics would cross reference what would be the best neighborhood for access to food, shelter, and avoiding law enforcement.  "

This data set archived all Social Services available throughout the City of Pittsburgh and Alleghany County. For this set we organized every available service by the neighborhood they were in and ranked them from highest to lowest. As this data set contained data from outside the city, after the data was sorted, we removed any instances from neighborhoods not in the city limits. "

The thought behind using this data is that the city has taken ownership of these properties after foreclosures and evictions, so any property listed here is likely to be vacant. Therefore, if a neighborhood has a high amount of listings, it can make it easier for someone to move between properties and live in good a good shelter while evading detection or causing issues for residents. For this data we did not take into account the total size of a given neighborhood as we decided what was more important was total availability and not strict density. \n"
